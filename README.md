# Overview

Python4Maid is a robust web application built using FastAPI and
SQLAlchemy, designed to provide a seamless and efficient experience. This
project includes Docker Compose for containerization, Nginx as a reverse
proxy, and Gunicorn as the application server.  Technologies Used

    FastAPI:
        FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for
        building APIs with Python 3.7+.

    SQLAlchemy:
        SQLAlchemy is a SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)
        library for Python. It provides a set of high-level API for
        interacting with relational databases.

    Docker Compose:
        Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container
        Docker applications. It allows you to define your applicationâ€™s
        services, networks, and volumes in a single file.

    Nginx:
        Nginx is a web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy,
        load balancer, and HTTP cache.

    Gunicorn:
        Gunicorn is a WSGI HTTP server for Python web applications. It
        is used to serve the FastAPI application.

**Setup and Installation**

Follow these instructions to set up and start the Python4Maid project:
Prerequisites

Install Docker and Docker Compose on your machine.

**Steps**

Clone the Repository:

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python4maid.git cd python4maid
```

Build and Run Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```


This command will build the Docker images and start the containers in
detached mode.

Access the Application: Once the containers are running, you can access
the FastAPI application through your browser at http://localhost.

Stop the Application:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

This command will stop and remove the containers.

**Project Structure**

    /app: Contains the FastAPI application code.  
    /nginx: Nginx configuration files.  
    /docker-compose.yml: Docker Compose configuration for the entire 
    project.

Feel free to explore the project and customize it according to your
requirements. Happy coding with Python4Maid!
